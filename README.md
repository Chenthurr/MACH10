🚀 MACH-10 TrafficOps+ Backend
An AI-driven intelligent traffic management system that optimizes urban traffic flow in real-time. This backend system handles data ingestion from various sources (sensors, cameras), performs AI-powered analysis, manages traffic signals, and coordinates emergency responses.

✨ Features
Real-time Data Processing: Ingests and processes live traffic data using a time-series database model.

Adaptive Signal Control: Dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings based on real-time congestion and pedestrian data.

Emergency Green Wave: Automatically clears a path for emergency vehicles by synchronizing traffic signals along their route.

AI-Powered Analytics: Provides insights into traffic patterns, pollution hotspots, and safety incidents.

RESTful API: A well-documented API for managing intersections, vehicles, and retrieving data.

WebSocket Integration: Real-time communication for instant alerts and dashboard updates.

Scheduled Tasks: Automated cron jobs for routine data analysis and system checks.

🛠️ Technology Stack
Node.js & Express: Core backend framework.

MongoDB: Primary database for storing traffic data, vehicle info, and analytics.

Mongoose: ODM for MongoDB.

Socket.IO: For real-time, bidirectional communication.

Node-Cron: For scheduling automated tasks.

Helmet & CORS: For API security and cross-origin resource sharing.

dotenv: For managing environment variables.
